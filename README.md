# Husvård - make maintenace fun again!(?)

Own a property? Well shiiiiit, let us help you with that anxiety!

## So for real, what is Husvård?

### Money in the bank
The purpose of husvård is to get you about the probably bi biggest goldmine of your life. Depending on where you live your house will increase by 520% in value by the time you want to sell it!

Crazy right, 520% that's a number that is hard to get somewhere else! BUT, there is a big but, if you don't maintain it, that number will sink like a stone. Regular maintenance is key to keeping your cost down, but also to plan to make sure you have the resources when you need them.

Husvård will help you with a forecast of how much your house will cost over time! And also help you to keep the focus on small and big tasks so that they get handled! 

### Anti procrastination
The purpose with husvård is to get your as of the couch and start fixing things.

One of the biggest problems with maintenance is that it is boring. Maybe not the work, but the planning and all the stuff that comes with it. The most boring fact with maintenance is that it never ends, this my friend is a hamster wheel of life. Though? Ready to give up…Yes?

### Make it simple!
With husvård, we help you simplify all the stuff that you need to do. We do that by dividing things into three categories: Tasks, Chores, and Projects. 

*Tasks:* Are anything that needs to be done e.g: clean the office, fix the step in the basement staircase, re-paint the south wall in the garage. Littery anything!

*Chores:* Are actually a task that just needs to be done every now and then, some more often than others. E.g.: Weekly water plants in the office, Quarterly clean shower drain, At the spring inspect window and putty

*Projects:* Every now and then we have bigger fish to fry. And planing and sorting out ideas to find your target, both ecstatically and economically. Husvård helps you keep focus so that you don’t get carried away and also plan for the future on which investments that are coming. Costs for the house is always something to keep in mind.

### Make it fun!
Husvård is great for family inclusion, share shores and get point for doing them, all members can set a score for different tasks and you will have a leading board with stars and stats and all kinds of ridicules stuff to keep you motivated.

Are you single well good for you! This app will help you stay motivated, get progress, and score all for your self! It is a feelgood-because-you-deserve-it kind of app. Mindfulness and that kind of stuff for the win!!

But if you are a serious adult kind of cat, you can turn that shit off! We will just offer you a back rub with your phone's oscillatory function as a reward! And you can skip all the fun badges and smileys we spent hundreds of hours creating then, I guess...
